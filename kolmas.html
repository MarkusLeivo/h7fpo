                <br>
                <p>It is often hard to pinpoint what is bothering you. It might be a combination of different things, so it can be difficult to identify the problem.</p>
                <p>However there are some things that likely have a negative effect on your mood. For example:</p>

                        <p>The first thing that you should remember, when feeling down, is that you are not alone. Talk to people, especially your family and friends. Let them know how you are feeling. A problem shared is a problem halved! Don't be afraid to ask for help.</p>

                        <p>Your life will never change unless you take action. How can you say something like "I can't do it", if you haven't even tried it. Or if you have, then did you try hard enough? Life is based around belief. So better get to it and start believing in yourself!</p>

                                    <li>Exercise helps your body release endorphins, the feel-good hormones. Exercising for at least 30 minutes a day, can improve your health by quite a bit. It is not necessary to have a complex training programme, just keep your body moving. Going for walks is a great place to start!</li>

                                    <li>Think about who might be a good source of support in a moment like this. Reach out to them, it can be a good way to break out of an uninspired mindset. If you aren't in a mood to hang out with your friend, sometimes getting out and being in the presence of other people can be helpful.</li>
