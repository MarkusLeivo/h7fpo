Usually, the best way to start something, is just to begin. Tackle your problems head on and you might just discover how capable you really are!</li>

                                    <li>Exercise helps your body release endorphins, the feel-good hormones. Exercising for at least 30 minutes a day, can improve your health by quite a bit. It is not necessary to have a complex training programme, just keep your body moving. Going for walks is a great place to start!</li>
